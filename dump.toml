# dump.toml — project-local config for dump-dir
#
# Place this file in any directory and run `dump-dir` from there.
# These settings OVERRIDE the global ~/.config/dump-dir/config.toml.
# Arrays replace rather than merge, so list everything you want.

# Example: for a Rust project, also skip build artifacts and generated files
#skip_globs = ["**/target", "**/src"]
